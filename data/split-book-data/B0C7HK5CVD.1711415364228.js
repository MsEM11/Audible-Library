window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An inquisitive life-form finds there’s more to existence than they ever dreamed in an imaginative short story by <i>New York Times</i> bestselling and Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author Ann Leckie.</p> <p>On a far-off colony, humans tower over the local species who grow the plants they need. Narr keeps the workers in line—someone has to. But when Narr learns just how short-lived their species is, the little alien embarks on a big mission: to find out why their people die and how to stop it. Stubborn and hopeful, Narr has a plan for the locals, for humans, and for the future.</p> <p><i>Ann Leckie’s</i> The Long Game <i>is part of</i> The Far Reaches<i>, a collection of science-fiction stories that stretch the imagination and open the heart. They can be read or listened to in one sitting.</i></p>";
