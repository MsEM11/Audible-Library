Academy Award-winning actress Anne Hathaway (<i>Rachel Getting Married, Alice in Wonderland, The Dark Knight Rises</i>) lends her voice to this uniquely American fairy tale.&nbsp;</p> <p>Follow the adventures of young Dorothy Gale and her dog Toto as they get swept away into the magical land of Oz , where they encounter characters and places you may remember from the movie - and several more that never made it to the big screen - on an unforgettable journey to the Emerald City.&nbsp;</p> <p>“It’s such a wonderful book and I was so happy to be a part of bringing it to life”, Ms. Hathaway said. “There are a lot of great voices in it. The more fun you have with it, the sillier and the more free you get with it, the better it is because it’s a story that can handle it. It’s amazing to be able to discover something new about something you feel you know so well.”</p>";
