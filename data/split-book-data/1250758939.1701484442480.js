window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Marissa Meyer's young adult contemporary romance, a girl is suddenly gifted with the ability to cast instant karma on those around her - both good and bad.</b></p> <p>Chronic overachiever Prudence Daniels is always quick to cast judgment on the lazy, rude, and arrogant residents of her coastal town. Her dreams of karmic justice are fulfilled when, after a night out with her friends, she wakes up with the sudden ability to cast instant karma on those around her.</p> <p>Pru giddily makes use of the power, punishing everyone from public vandals to mean gossips, but there is one person on whom her powers consistently backfire: Quint Erickson, her slacker of a lab partner. Quint is annoyingly cute and impressively noble, especially when it comes to his work with the rescue center for local sea animals.</p> <p>When Pru resigns herself to working at the rescue center for extra credit, she begins to uncover truths about baby otters, environmental upheaval, and romantic crossed signals - not necessarily in that order. Her newfound karmic insights reveal how thin the line is between virtue and vanity, generosity and greed...love and hate...and fate.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Feiwel &amp; Friends</b></p>";
