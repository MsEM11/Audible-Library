window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"There are only two reasons a nonseer would see a spirit on St. Mark's Eve,\" Neeve said. \"Either you're his true love... or you killed him.\" </p> <p>It is freezing in the churchyard, even before the dead arrive. Every year, Blue Sargent stands next to her clairvoyant mother as the soon-to-be dead walk past. Blue herself never sees them - not until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks directly to her. His name is Gansey, and Blue soon discovers that he is a rich student at Aglionby, the local private school. Blue has a policy of staying away from Aglionby boys. Known as Raven Boys, they can only mean trouble. </p> <p>But Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she can't entirely explain. He has it all - family money, good looks, devoted friends - but he's looking for much more than that. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little. </p> <p>For as long as she can remember, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love to die. She never thought this would be a problem. But now, as her life becomes caught up in the strange and sinister world of the Raven Boys, she's not so sure anymore. </p> <p>From Maggie Stiefvater, the best-selling and acclaimed author of the Shiver trilogy and <i>The Scorpio Races,</i> comes a spellbinding new series where the inevitability of death and the nature of love lead us to a place we've never been before.</p>";
