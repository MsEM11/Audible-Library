window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of</b><b><i> The Raven Boys</i></b><b>, a mesmerizing story of dreams and desires, death and destiny.&nbsp;</b></p> <p><i>The dreamers walk among us...and so do the dreamed. Those who dream cannot stop dreaming - they can only try to control it. Those who are dreamed cannot have their own lives - they will sleep forever if their dreamers die.&nbsp;</i></p> <p><i>And then there are those who are drawn to the dreamers. To use them. To trap them. To kill them before their dreams destroy us all.&nbsp;</i></p> <p>Ronan Lynch is a dreamer. He can pull both curiosities and catastrophes out of his dreams and into his compromised reality.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jordan Hennessy is a thief. The closer she comes to the dream object she is after, the more inextricably she becomes tied to it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Carmen Farooq-Lane is a hunter. Her brother was a dreamer...and a killer. She has seen what dreaming can do to a person. And she has seen the damage that dreamers can dor. But that is nothing compared to the destruction that is about to be unleashed....</p>";
