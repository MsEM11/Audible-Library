The first installment of a planned trilogy, <i>Wither</i> introduces listeners to a bleak world where a mysterious disease kills most women by the age of 20 and men by the age of 25.

But, despite her new husbandâ€™s wealth, she wants nothing more than to escape her servitude and return home before time runs out.</p>";
