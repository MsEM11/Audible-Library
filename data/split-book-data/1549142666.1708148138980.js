She believed she knew every horror, and was beyond surprise. She was wrong.</i></p> <p>In the wake of tragedy, neither Lazlo nor Sarai are who they were before. One a god, the other a ghost, they struggle to grasp the new boundaries of their selves as dark-minded Minya holds them hostage, intent on vengeance against Weep.</p> <p>Lazlo faces an unthinkable choice—save the woman he loves, or <i>everyone else</i>?—while Sarai feels more helpless than ever.

What was done with thousands of children born in the citadel nursery? And most important of all, as forgotten doors are opened and new worlds revealed: Must heroes always slay monsters, or is it possible to <i>save</i> them instead?</p> <p>Love and hate, revenge and redemption, destruction and salvation all clash in this gorgeous sequel to the <i>New York Times</i> best seller, <i>Strange the Dreamer</i>.</p>";
