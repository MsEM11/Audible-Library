window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the internationally acclaimed best-selling author of <i>Code Name Verity</i> comes a stunning new story of pearls, love and murder. </p> <p>Sixteen-year-old Julie Beaufort-Stuart is returning to her family's ancestral home in Perthshire for one last summer. It is not an idyllic return to childhood. Her grandfather's death has forced the sale of the house and estate, and this will be a summer of good-byes. Not least to the McEwen family - Highland travellers who have been part of the landscape for as long as anyone can remember, loved by the family, loathed by the authorities. Tensions are already high when a respected London archivist goes missing, presumed murdered. Suspicion quickly falls on the McEwens, but Julie knows not one of them would do such a thing and is determined to prove everyone wrong. And then she notices the family's treasure trove of pearls is missing. </p> <p>This beautiful and evocative novel is the story of the irrepressible and unforgettable Julie, set in the year before the Second World War and the events of <i>Code Name Verity</i>. It is also a powerful portrayal of a community under pressure and one girl's determination for justice. </p>";
