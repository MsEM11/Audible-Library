window.bookSummaryJSON = "The students in class 6B become nervous when their teacher receives an anonymous note claiming someone in the room is a witch. For in this society, witches are outlawed, whether they are good or bad. In fact, witches are burned at the stake, because that's the law. Since nobody really wants to be burned at the stake, each student is desperate to prove somebody else is the guilty party. As the accusations fly, only the great enchanter Chrestomanci can root out the truth. With an irresistible blend of magic and humor, <i>Witch Week</i> is sure to be enjoyed by children of all ages.";
