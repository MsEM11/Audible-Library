window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Finalist, Paranormal, 2014</b></p> <p>The ever after, the demonic realm that parallels our own, is shrinking, and if it disappears, so does all magic. It’s up to witch-turned-daywalking-demon Rachel Morgan to fix the ever-after before the fragile balance between magic users and humans fails. </p> <p>Of course, there’s also the small fact that she caused the ley line to rip in the first place, and her life is forfeit unless she can fix it. And that the most powerful demon in the ever after - the soul-eater Ku'Sox Sha-Ku'ru - has vowed to destroy Rachel, and has kidnapped her friend and goddaughter as leverage. If Rachel doesn’t give herself up, they will die. </p> <p>Forced by circumstance, Rachel teams up with elven tycoon Trent Kalamack - a prospect fraught with dangers of the heart as well as betrayal of the soul - to return to the ever after and rescue those she loves. </p> <p>Both worlds teeter on the brink, one on a possible interspecies war, the other for its very existence, and it’s up to Rachel to keep both from being destroyed.</p>";
