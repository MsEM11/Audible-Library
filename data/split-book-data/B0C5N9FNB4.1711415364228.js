window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The million-copy, New York Times bestselling Murderbot series is back in another full-length novel adventure!</p> <p>Am I making it worse? I think I'm making it worse.</p> <p>Everyone's favorite lethal SecUnit is back.</p> <p>Following the events in Network Effect, the Barish-Estranza corporation has sent rescue ships to a newly colonized planet in peril, as well as additional SecUnits. But if there's an ethical corporation out there, Murderbot has yet to find it, and if Barish-Estranza can't have the planet, they're sure as hell not leaving without something. If that something just happens to be an entire colony of humans, well, a free workforce is a decent runner-up prize.</p> <p>But there's something wrong with Murderbot; it isn't running within normal operational parameters. ART's crew and the humans from Preservation are doing everything they can to protect the colonists, but with Barish-Estranza's SecUnit-heavy persuasion teams, they're going to have to hope Murderbot figures out what's wrong with itself, and fast!</p> <p>Yeah, this plan is... not going to work.</p>";
