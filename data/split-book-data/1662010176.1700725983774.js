window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When violinist Anna Sun accidentally achieves career success with a viral YouTube video, she finds herself incapacitated and burned out from her attempts to replicate that moment. And when her longtime boyfriend announces he wants an open relationship before making a final commitment, a hurt and angry Anna decides that if he wants an open relationship, then she does, too.&nbsp;Translation: She's going to embark on a string of one-night stands. The more unacceptable the men, the better.&nbsp;</p> <p>That’s where tattooed, motorcycle-riding Quan Diep comes in. Their first attempt at a one-night stand fails, as does their second, and their third, because being with Quan is more than sex - he accepts Anna on an unconditional level that she has just started to understand herself.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, when tragedy strikes Anna’s family, she takes on a role that she is ill-suited for, until the burden of expectations threatens to destroy her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Anna and Quan have to fight for their chance at love, but to do that, they also have to fight for themselves.&nbsp;</p>";
