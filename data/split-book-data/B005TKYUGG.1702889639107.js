window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>To these seven narratives of neurological disorder, Dr. Sacks brings the same humanity, poetic observation, and infectious sense of wonder that are apparent in his best sellers <i>Awakenings</i> and <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i>. These men, women, and one extraordinary child emerge as brilliantly adaptive personalities, whose conditions have not so much debilitated them as ushered them into another reality.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: Some changes have been made to the original manuscript with the permission of Oliver Sacks.</b> </p>";
