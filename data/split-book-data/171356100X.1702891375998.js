window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Bestselling author Keiichiro Hirano offers a timeless ode to love’s fragility and its resilience in this delicate, award-winning novel. </b></p> <p>Classical guitarist Satoshi Makino has toured the world and is at the height of his career when he first lays eyes on journalist Yoko Komine. Their bond forms instantly.&nbsp;</p> <p>Upon their first meeting, after Makino’s concert in Tokyo, they begin a conversation that will go on for years, with long spells of silence broken by powerful moments of connection. She’s drawn by Makino’s tender music and his sensitivity, and he is intrigued by Yoko’s refinement and intellect. But neither knows enough about love to see it blooming nor has the confidence to make the first move. Will their connection endure, weaving them back together like instruments in a symphony, or will fate lead them apart?</p> <p>Blending the harmonies of Kazuo Ishiguro’s <i>Nocturnes</i> and the sensuality of Ian McEwan’s <i>Enduring Love</i>, <i>At the End of the Matinee</i> is an enchanting and thought-provoking love story.</p>";
