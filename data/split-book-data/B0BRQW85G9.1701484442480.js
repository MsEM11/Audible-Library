window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>True love is put to the test in this romantic comedy brought to hilarious life by Santino Fontana (</b><b><i>Frozen</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i></b><b>), Stephanie Einstein, and a full cast!</b></p> <p>This Psych 312 assignment just might send me off the deep end. Determining whether love at first sight really exists with Robbie Moravian as my project partner, of all people?</p> <p>He’s the sappiest man alive, so upbeat I could scream, and clearly rooting for happy endings at every turn. How does he not learn from experience considering our own meet-cute last semester almost got us expelled?</p> <p>But we both need to pass this course to graduate. So we’re interviewing five random couples about their meet-cutes and relationships and spending all this time together. Which is certainly...educational.</p> <p>Because it turns out Robbie isn’t just the charming golden boy I thought I knew. There’s some actual depth beneath all those lame dad jokes and the ‘70s-inspired thrift wardrobe (even if he does look ridiculously great in a flared collar). Next thing I know he’s walking me back to my office on the regular and finishing all my sentences and protecting me from freak storms, and...</p> <p>Wait. Could Robbie be right? Can happy endings really come from unhappy beginnings? Is he about to change my entire world view?</p> <p>Group projects are the worst.</p> <p>Now available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
