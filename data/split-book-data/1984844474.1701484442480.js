window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this first book in the legendary </b><b><i>Lymond Chronicles</i></b><b>, Francis Crawford of Lymond, traitor, murderer, nobleman, returns to Scotland to redeem his reputation and save his home.</b></p> <p>It is 1547, and Scotland has been humiliated by an English invasion and is threatened by machinations elsewhere beyond its borders, but it is still free. Paradoxically, her freedom may depend on a man who stands accused of treason. He is Francis Crawford of Lymond, a scapegrace nobleman of crooked felicities and murderous talents, possessed of a scholar's erudition and a tongue as wicked as a rapier. In <i>The Game of Kings</i>, this extraordinary antihero returns to the country that has outlawed him to redeem his reputations even at the risk of his life.</p>";
