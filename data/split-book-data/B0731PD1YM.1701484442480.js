window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A collection of four chilling novels, ingeniously wrought gems of terror from the brilliantly imaginative number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Fireman</i>, Joe Hill. </p> <p>\"One of America's finest horror writers\" (<i>Time</i> magazine), Joe Hill has been hailed among legendary talents such as Peter Straub, Neil Gaiman, and Jonathan Lethem. In <i>Strange Weather</i>, this \"compelling chronicler of human nature's continual war between good and evil\" (<i>Providence Journal-Bulletin</i>), who \"pushes genre conventions to new extremes\" (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>), deftly expose the darkness that lies just beneath the surface of everyday life. </p> <p><i>Snapshot</i>, performed by Wil Wheaton, is the disturbing story of a Silicon Valley adolescent who finds himself threatened by The Phoenician, a tattooed thug who possesses a Polaroid Instant Camera that erases memories snap by snap. </p> <p>A young man takes to the skies to experience his first parachute jump...and winds up a castaway on an impossibly solid cloud, a Prospero's island of roiling vapor that seems animated by a mind of its own in <i>Aloft</i>, performed by Dennis Boutsikaris. </p> <p>On a seemingly ordinary day in Boulder, Colorado, the clouds open up in a downpour of nails - splinters of bright crystal that shred the skin of anyone not safely under cover. <i>Rain</i>, performed by Kate Mulgrew, explores this escalating apocalyptic event as the deluge of nails spreads out across the country and around the world. </p> <p>In <i>Loaded</i>, performed by Stephen Lang, a mall security guard in a coastal Florida town courageously stops a mass shooting and becomes a hero to the modern gun rights movement. But under the glare of the spotlights, his story begins to unravel, taking his sanity with it. When an out-of-control summer blaze approaches the town, he will reach for the gun again and embark on one last day of reckoning. </p> <p>With an afterword from Joe Hill, read by the author. </p> <p>Masterfully exploring classic literary themes through the prism of the supernatural, <i>Strange Weather</i> is a stellar collection from an artist who is \"quite simply the best horror writer of our generation\" (Michael Kortya). </p>";
