Only a modest Quaker girl can reach him, but when she helps him to escape, she's swept into his glittering aristocratic world, her life torn apart by his desperate attempt to save himself. </p> <p>Laura Kinsale personally chose the exceptional talent of Nicholas Boulton to narrate her classic romance <i>Flowers from the Storm</i> - cited by readers of <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>Glamour</i> magazine as \"one of the greatest love stories of all time\" - creating a fresh and unique work that brings all the power and intensity of the original to audio.</p>";
