window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Charming, rich, and clever, heiress Emma Woodhouse has no need for an occupation - or a husband. Still, she considers herself quite skilled at matchmaking. Although her dear friend Mr. Knightley advises against it, there is nothing that she enjoys more than entangling herself in the romantic lives of others. But when one of her well-intentioned plans goes awry - as Mr. Knightley rightly predicted - Emma must face the consequences of her meddling. </p> <p>The delightfully imperfect Emma and her Mr. Knightley have captured the hearts of generations of readers. A lively comedy of manners that has been adapted several times for the screen, Emma is the last work Jane Austen lived to see published. </p> <p>AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature's most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds. </p> <p>Revised edition: Previously published as <i>Emma</i>, this edition of <i>Emma (AmazonClassics Edition)</i> includes editorial revisions. </p>";
